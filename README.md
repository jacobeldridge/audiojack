**audiojack**

This was some bare-bones software I made overnight using the Python Eel library after our free trial ran out on some other software.
This app was used during our school's annual OneAct production. It got the job done and this was my first completed native Windows app.
The software is also going to be used for the annual OneAct competition held for Georgia Highschools.
Very Proud...2am was worth it.
